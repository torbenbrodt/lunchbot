# Lunchbot for Slack
The Lunchbot can be used to register for Lunches, ask for reservation status and more.

It includes a docker compose file using Flask-Restless + Flask-Sqlalchemy + Postgres.
This project includes a HTTP API for CRUD operations. The database is described in [flask/app.py](flask/app.py)

You can browse the api by calling [http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/lunch](http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/lunch) in your browser.

The actual chatbot will be created during the Hackathon "[Create your own chatbot! by plista](https://www.meetup.com/plistatecheventsberlin/events/238379390/)" taking place in June.

## Install requirements and Get the code
To install Docker see instructions at https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/. I used the simple command ```curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh```

To install Docker Compose see instructions at https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

Then get the code
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/torbenbrodt/lunchbot
```

## Get slack token
Your bot connects via a simple slack-token to the corresponding slack-team.
For sake of simplicity the workshop organizers can provide you with token for the hackathon slack-team [http://lunchbot-hackathon.slack.com](#lunchbot-hackathon.slack.com).

Of course you can also use your personal slack channel. In this case get a Bot token from: http://my.slack.com/services/new/bot
Afterwards update your docker compose environment
```bash
echo "token=xxxx-xxxxxxxxx-xxxx" > .env
```

## Develop, Improve and Run the lunchbot
Start flask and postgres via.
```bash
docker-compose up flask some-postgres
```
Your code lives in [chatbot/app/server.js](chatbot/app/server.js). Here the actual work happens.
To run it please execute
```bash
docker-compose up chatbot
```

### Debugging in bash
Sometimes docker-composer is just to generic and you want to execute commands on your own.
```bash
docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app -v "$PWD/chatbot/app":/usr/src/app/app -w /usr/src/app --env-file .env lunchbot_chatbot /bin/bash
```
